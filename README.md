# History
#### *I was actively looking for work and an interesting company responded to my application. It was a vacancy for a "Golang Developer" on a 100% remote basis. The guys from that company sent me the task and gave me 24 hours to complete it. The details of the task are described in the README.txt file. In the repository you will find my work, which I managed to complete in the given 24 hours for this job. I will not mention the company name for company security reasons.*
